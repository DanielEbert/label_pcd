# TODO

- save and load colored pcd
  - pre-color pcd based on epolidar with dso
- toggle to show marked points only
- top down image based on simple coloring rules like density and avg height, and sam2 integration
- multiple pcds in the same view
- move between pcds easily
- creating a polygon node should select it
- likely add ignore color

- 1 click mark img for relabel newly and from existing set
- ml uses that directly, reruns, and lets me pick for relabel again
