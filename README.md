# TODO

- add polygon tool
- when camera goes down too low we flip
- only topview can see polygon and move them, and highlight the would-be colored points -- the points inside the polygon so the top view can analyse
- toggle to show marked points only

- 1 click mark img for relabel newly and from existing set
- ml uses that directly, reruns, and lets me pick for relabel again
